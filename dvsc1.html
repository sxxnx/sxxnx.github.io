      <h1>Data Visualization Society Challenge</h1>
      <h2>Summary</h2>
      <p>Here is my contribution to the first Data Visualization Society Challenge. The data includes the
        first 3500 members of the Slack. Each member had to evaluate him/herself in 3 main topics : Data, Visualization
         and Society (each one divided into 3 sub-topics). The dataset is composed of the mean score of each member
         in the 3 main topics and the position (lat, long) and time each member subscribed.</p>
      <h2>Reading the chart</h2>
      <div class='explanation'>
        <p>I divided the data between all continents, the algorithm to sort by continent may not be perfect, that is why
        there is some data falling into the "Other" category (or maybe people for outer space ;)).</p>
        <p>The main goal of the chart is to visualize where the members come from and how they evaluate themselves in both
        categories : Data, Visualization and Society.</p>
        <p>If you hover the different continents you get some extra info about each one, such as the mean score for
        each category and the number of members.</p>
